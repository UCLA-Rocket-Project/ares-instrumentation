The Odyssey 2 uses the Adafruit Feather M0 Adalogger. Some additional configuration is required
on the Arduino IDE in order to be able to use it to upload code to the M0. That information can be found at this link: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-adalogger/setup
and consequently https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-adalogger/using-with-arduino-ide

Ground instrumentation is handled by LabVIEW code.
