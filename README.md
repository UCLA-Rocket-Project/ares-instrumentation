Included is the source code for all previous ares instrumentation systems. Such systems are labelled:
2017 Kerosene System (oldest)
Odyssey 1 (second most recent)
Odyssey 2 (most recent)

Also included in each folder are the libraries that must be included in the code. It is recommended to use the libraries uploaded here as 
opposed to the original libraries from the internet, as some additions may have been made to better suit the Ares system.
